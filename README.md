# E07a-Particles
For this assignment, I got to play with particles and emitters. I first went to line 113 to change the image. I chose fire as my image. Next, I edited lines 43-54. There were two values in lines 43-54, like this: (open_color.red_5, 4). The first value represents the color and the secound value represents the number of frames for the color. Then, I went to lines 17-28 to edit particles, such as their size. After editing, I ran python file in terminal to check if it works or not. Finally I edited LICENSE and README.md.
